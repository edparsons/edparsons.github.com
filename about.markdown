I'm a London boy living in San Francisco. I learned to be a software developer when I was 12 when my Dad bought me Visual Studios 2013 and a month later found me my first client. Since then I've been developing software and all sorts of platforms.

My dream is to build my own start up, which seems to be happening through Acutulus.co the consulting company I started for my E visa to the US. At some point, Acutulus will have it's own product and idea but until then we're helping start-ups in the Bay Area building their apps, technology and pretty much anything that a computer can help with.

If you're starting something or have an idea, I'd love to hear from you and we can chat about how technology, mobile phone or anything we a chip might be able to help you.

Lastly, this blog is written in English not English (US), so those aren't spelling mistakes ;)
